# Pac-Man
## Project Description
In this project for class we used our knowledge of the DOM and working with arrays and functions to complete this. When the code is run a pac-man character moves accross the screen, then turns once its reached the end of the screen, this loops continously.

## How to Run
You can run this by either cloning the repository, or downloading a copy of the entire repository.

## Future 
As my coding skills continue to develop, I might add to this project.
Ideas
- Add ghosts, and food
- Give the user the ability to control the direction pac-man moves
- Pac-man will move in 2 dimensions instead of 1
